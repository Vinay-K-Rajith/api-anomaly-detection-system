# API Anomaly Detection System

## Overview

The API Anomaly Detection System is an AI-powered monitoring solution designed for large-scale, distributed multi-API software platforms. This system automatically analyzes API performance, detects anomalies, and provides predictive insights to maintain optimal platform health across distributed architectures spanning on-premises, cloud, and multi-cloud environments.

## Features

- **Real-time API Monitoring**: Track response times, error rates, and other critical metrics across all APIs
- **Cross-Environment Analysis**: Monitor APIs regardless of their hosting environment (on-premises, cloud, multi-cloud)
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automatically identify unusual patterns in API behavior using AI/ML algorithms
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast potential issues before they impact system reliability
- **End-to-End Request Journey Tracking**: Follow requests as they traverse multiple environments
- **Intelligent Alerting**: Receive context-aware notifications about potential issues

## Architecture

The system is built using a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Data Collection Layer**: Gathers metrics and logs from APIs across all environments
- **Log Aggregation Layer**: Centralizes and processes log data
- **Stream Processing Layer**: Analyzes data in real-time
- **Data Storage Layer**: Stores historical and processed data
- **AI/ML Engine**: Detects anomalies and generates predictions
- **Visualization & Alerting Layer**: Provides dashboards and notifications

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **TimescaleDB**: Time-series data storage
- **Elasticsearch**: Log storage and search
- **Kibana**: Visualization dashboards
- **Kafka**: Message broker for data streaming
- **Apache Flink**: Stream processing
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms for anomaly detection and prediction
